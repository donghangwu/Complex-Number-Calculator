# Complex-Number-Calculator
```
User can enter one of the following commands: LET, LOAD, SAVE, or PRINT, EXIT, or WEXIT.
a. The command LET must be followed by a space, then a letter (A â€“ Z), a space, then an equal sign (=), then by the complex number the user wishes 
to assign to this letter. (e.g. LET F = 2 + 4i). The result printed upon successful completion will be F = 2 + 4iin this example.

b. The command PRINT must be followed by a space then the letter representing a pre-stored complex number (e.g PRINT F). 
The program will respond by printing F = 2 + 4i, for example.

c. The command SAVE shall be followed by a filename. If the filename does not end in .complex, the program shall ensure that it ends in .complex by
either adding this extension or correcting the extension that the user provided. Of course, all verification of overwriting files, etc, must be done.

d. The command LOAD shall be followed by a filename. If the filename does not end in .complex, the program shall ensure that it ends in .complex by 
either adding this extension or correcting the extension that the user provided.

e. The command EXIT shall exit the program. If the user  has not immediately prior to this command saved the memory contents,
the program shall prompt the user if user wish to save the data to a file. If user do, the restrictions for SAVE apply.

f. The command WEXIT shall  be followed by a filename. The program will exit the program after following the guidelines for SAVE above.
